# Library Management System

The project is designed to demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The main objective of this project is to develop a mini-system to manage books and users in a library setting. It serves as a practical exercise to solidify understanding of key OOP concepts

## Key Features
Book Management: Add new books to the library's catalog.

Issue/Return System: Implements the core logic for issuing a book to a user and processing its return.

Status Tracking: Tracks the availability of books (whether they are issued or not).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple classes, each with a distinct responsibility, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns.

Book.java: This class acts as a blueprint for book objects. It contains attributes like title, author, and a boolean isIssued to track its status.

User.java: This class is a blueprint for user objects. It stores the user's name, userId, and a list of borrowedBooks.

Library.java: This is the main management class. It holds lists of all books and users and contains the core methods to 
issueBook and returnBook.

Main.java: This is the entry point of the application. It's used to create instances of the library, add sample data (books and users), and demonstrate the system's functionality.
